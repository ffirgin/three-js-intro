# three-js-intro
## Description


This project showcases bringing in 3D models for a really fun and interactive user experience. The motivation behind working on this was to simply showcase the use of 3D models within a clean and sleek design of a website.


After cloning the repo to your system, open the files and within the terminal run:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start Vite and open a locally hosted version of the project.

There is also some fun functionality with clicking and dragging the Kendama. You can select a color by clicking and dragging around the screen.
